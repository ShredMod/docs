                One interesting feature of ShredMod and TurboWarp is 
                that you can enable and disable many of its features. I will cover them below.<br>
                <h2>60 FPS</h2>
                Enable through the Advanced Settings menu. This setting allows you to run your projects at a different
                number of loops per second. You can also set this to a custom value.
                <h2>Interpolation</h2>
                Interpolation is similar to Custom FPS. However, with interpolation, the project runs with delta time 
                (all projects run at 30FPS speed) but still look faster and smoother.
                <h2>High Quality Pen</h2>
                High Quality Pen lets the pen in Scratch look much better if you zoom in, looking more like vector than 
                bitmap.
                <h2>Remove Fencing</h2>
                Remove Fencing lets sprites move offscreen, become as large or small as they want, 
                and makes touching blocks work offscreen. This may improve performance in some projects.
                <h2>Remove Miscellaneous Limits</h2>
                Remove Miscellaneous Limits increases minimum and maximum pen size, some scripts run immediately, and the pitch range is increased.
                More will be added in the future.
                <h2>Infinite Clones</h2>
                This setting disables Scratch's 300 clone limit.
                <h2>Warp Timer</h2>
                This setting makes the script still run during a freezing script instead of stopping while the script is frozen.
                <h2>Custom Stage Size</h2>
                This setting changes Scratch's stage size from a 4:3 ratio to any ratio you want, with 640x360 being widescreen.
                I reccomend to, instead of making a bigger stage, change the aspect ratio and allow fullscreen.
                <h2>Disable Compiler</h2>
                This option turns off the TurboWarp compiler.
                This is only useful when debugging bugs in the compiler or when using the editor to create a project.
